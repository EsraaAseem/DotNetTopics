
 5. Data Management
Database per Service

Managing transactions across services:

Sagas Pattern (Orchestration vs Choreography)

Event-driven architecture

Data Replication & Synchronization

 6. Scaling and Resiliency
Load Balancing

Circuit Breaker (like using Resilience4j or Polly)

Retry policies

Health checks and monitoring

Distributed Tracing (Jaeger, Zipkin)

7. Deployment and Hosting
Docker basics (Containerizing Microservices)

Kubernetes basics (Managing Microservices at scale)

CI/CD pipelines (automating build and deploy)

Cloud Providers (AWS, Azure, GCP basics)

 8. Tools and Technologies
API Gateway (Ocelot, YARP for .NET)

Service Mesh (Istio, Linkerd)

Message Brokers (RabbitMQ, Kafka)

Observability tools (Prometheus, Grafana)

 9. Best Practices
Centralized logging (ELK Stack: Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

Configuration Management (Centralized config like Consul / Config Server)

Versioning APIs

Graceful degradation and fallback strategies

 10. Real-world Patterns
Strangler Fig Pattern (migrating from Monolith to Microservices)

Backend for Frontend (BFF Pattern)

Sidecar Pattern

Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL)

Bonus (if you want to go pro):
Serverless Microservices (AWS Lambda, Azure Functions)

Domain-Driven Design (deep)

Event Sourcing and CQRS patterns
